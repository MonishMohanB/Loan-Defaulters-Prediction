# Loan-Defaulters-Prediction

Our Aim is to build a model to predict the probability that someone will default on a loan given the various features in the
data set. A default is identified by a loan status listed as in default, over 30 days late, or charged off.

1) Performing data cleaning and exploratory analysis .

2) Build a predictive model to determine who is likely to default if they are extended a loan.
